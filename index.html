    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      where it was thought inappropriate to incorporate them directly into that specification
      at the point in time when they were written, but they were too small to warrant
      writing a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at a later time, it is a good time to add them to the base specification, that
      will be done. Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension, consensus on
      adding it, and implementation experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains a number of sections that have extensions for one specific
      interface or dictionary in the base specification. When an extension only affects
      one interface or dictionary, it will only be described there. If an extension affects
      multiple interfaces or dictionaries, there will be a subsection in the informative
      "Overviews" section that describes the extension as a whole, while the normative changes
      are in the sections for the individual interfaces.

      <h3>RTP header control</h3>
      <p>
        The extension for RTP header extension control consists of 2 parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An extension to {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, to set and query the RTP header extensions
          negotiated in SDP.
        </li>
        <li>An extension to {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters}}, to be used with setParameters()
          to set the RTP header extensions sent by an {{RTCRtpSender}}.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
        the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
        detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
        extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
        extension IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
        RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
        influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
        control the number of extensions offered.

        In the <a data-cite="WEBRTC#set-description">set a session description</a> algorithm, add a step
        right after the step that sets transceiver.[[\Sender]].[[\SendCodecs]],
        saying "For each transciever, set <a>[[\HeaderExtensionsNegotiated]]</a> to
        an empty list, and then
        for each <code>"a=hdrext"</code> line, add an appropriate
        {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability}} to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithms for generating initial offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.1,
        replace "for each supported RTP header extension, an "a=extmap" line, as specified in
        [[RFC5285]], section 5" " with "For each RTP header extension "e"
        listed in <a>[[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]]</a> where {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability/direction}} is not {{RTCRtpTransceiverDirection/"stopped"}}, an "a=extmap"
        line, as specified in [[RFC5285]], section 5, with direction taken from "e"'s {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability/direction}}
        attribute."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating subsequent offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.2, replace "The
        RTP header extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer"
        with "For each RTP header extension listed in <a>[[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]]</a> that is
        also present in the most recent answer, and where {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability/direction}} is not {{RTCRtpTransceiverDirection/"stopped"}}, generate
        an appropriate "a=extmap" line with "direction" set according to the rules of [[RFC5285]]
        section 6, considering the {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability/direction}} in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] to indicate the
        answerer's desired usage". This preserves the property that the set of extensions
        may not grow with subsequent offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating initial answers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.3.1, replace "For
        each supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer" with "For each
        supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer and is also present in

          <p>This attribute allows the application to specify a target duration
          of time between network reception of media and playout. The
          User Agent SHOULD NOT playout audio or video that is received unless
          this amount of time has passed in seconds, allowing the User
          Agent to perform more or less buffering than it might otherwise do.
          This allows to influence the tradeoffs between having a higher delay
          and the risk that buffers such as the jitter buffer will run out of
          audio or video frames to play due to network jitter.</p>
          <p>The User Agent may have a <dfn>minimum allowed delay</dfn> and a

          constraints.</p>
          <p class="note">
            The playout delay hint applies even if DTX is used. For example, if

            influence the User Agent to buffer these packets rather than playing

            synchronization mechanism will automatically delay all others
            paired tracks. If multiple such paired tracks are delayed through

            of those hints will take precedence in synchronization mechanism.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            The receiver's average delay can be measured as the delta

            Authenticated encryption is used for message encryption and

    <h2>Timestamp behavior</h2>
    <h2>RTCRtpSender timestamp effects on packet NTP and RTP timestamps</h2>
    <p>
      The user agent defines a <dfn class="export">frame timestamp</dfn> being the same as the [= capture timestamp =] of the frame being sent on the {{RTCRtpSender}} {{MediaStreamTrack}} if it is set.
      If it is unset the user agent estimates a timestamp from the sent frame's [= presentation timestamp =] together with the
      time it was received by the {{RTCRtpSender}}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NTP and RTP timestamps of the encoded frame corresponding to the frame being sent on the {{RTCRtpSender}} {{MediaStreamTrack}} are sourced from the [= frame timestamp =].
    </p>

    <h2>RTCRtpReceiver timestamps</h2>
    <h3>Remote capture timestamp</h3>
    <p>
      <!-- TODO: How this is estimated is under specified and should be fixed, but the section holds the requestVideoFrameCallback text for now -->
      For a frame produced in a {{RTCRtpReceiver}} track, the user agent computes a
      <dfn class="export">remote capture timestamp</dfn>. It is a best-effort estimate of the local capture
      time on the sender translated to the receiver clock, and can use methods like using RTCP SR
      as specified in [[?RFC3550]] Section 6.4.1, or by other alternative means if use by RTCP SR
      isn't feasible.
    </p><p>
      Each frame's [= capture timestamp =] is set to the [= remote capture timestamp =], if available.
    </p>
    <h3>Received RTP timestamp</h3>
    <p>
      For a frame produced in a {{RTCRtpReceiver}} track, the frame's [=RTP timestamp=] is set
      from the RTP timestamp of constituent packets of the corresponding received encoded frame.
    </p>
    <h3>Receive timestamp</h3>
    <p>
      For a frame produced in a {{RTCRtpReceiver}} track, the [=receive timestamp=] is set
      as the time the corresponding encoded frame was received by the platform, i.e. the time at which the
      last packet belonging to this frame was received over the network.
